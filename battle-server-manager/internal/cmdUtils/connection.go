// quickly. It is wrong for deciding whether a battle server we just spawned has
// finished binding: a loaded machine can take longer than 100ms to complete the
// handshake, the readiness loop gives up after waitInitTimeout and then kills the
// process it just started. A refused connection still returns immediately, so a
// generous timeout costs nothing while the port is genuinely closed.
