// Package notify sends a desktop notification when the game session is over.
//
// It exists because of when the agent runs: it was started by the launcher, it
// outlives it, and by the time it has something to say the terminal it printed
// to is a window nobody is looking at any more. The notification is the only
// signal that reaches the user at the moment they care about, which is minutes
// after they stopped paying attention.
//
// The notification never decides anything. A failure to show one is logged and
// otherwise ignored, because a user who cannot see a toast must still get the
// same exit code, and a user with no notification service at all must not get a
// different one.
