## Starting the Battle Server

### Path

Depending on the game and version, the path can be one of these two:

* `Drive:\Path\To\Game\BattleServer.exe`
* `Drive:\Path\To\Game\BattleServer\BattleServer.exe`

There is an exception: AoM: RT includes a buggy implementation and requires a more modern version. The best is to use
the newer version found in AoE II: DE.

### Executable

#### Arguments

##### Basic

* `-region` (string): the region identifier. It must be an unique string for a given game, but it is recommended to use
  a meaningful name such as the PC name in lower case. E.g., `roger-pc`.
* `-name` (string): the label for the region. It should be an unique string for a given game, but it is recommended to
  use a meaningful name such as the PC name. Only used in AoE II: DE. E.g., `Roger-PC`.

##### Ports

* `-relaybroadcastPort` (1-65535, UDP): used for broadcasting the server presence in the LAN. Recommended to be set to
  `0`
  to not interfere with the LAN Battle Server and because the server must be manually configured too.
* `-bsPort` (1-65535, TCP): main port to connect to the Battle Server.
* `-webSocketPort` (1-65535, TCP): websocket port to connect to the Battle Server.
* `-outOfBandPort` (1-65535, TCP): out-of-band (observer) communication. Missing in AoE: DE.

Note: All ports must be free and are recommended to be above `1024` to avoid requiring admin rights. The
host firewall will need to
allow incoming connections to these ports.

##### SSL

* `-sslCert` (string): path to the SSL certificate in PEM format. It can be any certificate that all clients trust.
  Recommended to use the server certificate as residing in `<server>/resources/certificates/cert.pem` and using the
  launcher on the clients to ensure it is trusted.
* `-sslKey` (string): path to the SSL private key in PEM format. Recommended to use the server key as residing in
  `<server>/resources/certificates/key.pem` and using the launcher on the clients to ensure the certificate is trusted.

### Examples

The examples assume the server is installed in `C:\AgeLANServer`, the server certificate and key are already
generated and that you are located in the battle server directory using the `Powershell` interpreter.

#### AoE: DE

`& ".\BattleServer.exe" -simulationPeriod 25 -relayBroadcastPort 0 -region local -bsPort 30001 webSocketPort 30002 -sslKey C:\AgeLANServer\resources\certificates\key.pem -sslCert C:\AgeLANServer\resources\certificates\cert.pem`

#### AoE II: DE

`& ".\BattleServer.exe" -simulationPeriod 125 -relayBroadcastPort 0 -region local -name Local -bsPort 30003 webSocketPort 30004 -outOfBandPort 30005 -sslKey C:\AgeLANServer\resources\certificates\key.pem -sslCert C:\AgeLANServer\resources\certificates\cert.pem`

#### AoE III: DE

`& ".\BattleServer.exe" -simulationPeriod 50 -relayBroadcastPort 0 -region local -bsPort 30006 webSocketPort 30007 -outOfBandPort 30008 -sslKey C:\AgeLANServer\resources\certificates\key.pem -sslCert C:\AgeLANServer\resources\certificates\cert.pem`

#### AoM: RT

`& ".\BattleServer.exe" -simulationPeriod 50 -relayBroadcastPort 0 -region local -bsPort 30007 webSocketPort 30008 -outOfBandPort 30009 -sslKey C:\AgeLANServer\resources\certificates\key.pem -sslCert C:\AgeLANServer\resources\certificates\cert.pem`

## Configuring the Server

For each battle server instance you run you will need to edit `<server>/resources/config.toml` and inside `[Games]`
section, add `[[Games.<game>.BattleServers]]` where game is one of `age1`, `age3`, or `age3`.
inside that subsection the following properties are required (with the arguments matching):

| Battle Server argument | Server configuration key |
|------------------------|--------------------------|
| `-region`              | `Region`                 |
| `-name`                | `Name`                   |
| `-bsPort`              | `BsPort`                 |
| `-outOfBandPort`       | `OutOfBandPort`          |
| `-webSocketPort`       | `WebSocketPort`          |

Additionally, the `IPv4` which should point to a user-accessible IP. E.g., `192.168.1.2`. When the Battle Server resides
in the same machine as the server, using `auto` is the best option as it will ensure the same IP the client uses to
connect to
the server is also used to connect to the Battle Server.

### Examples

The examples mirror the battle server examples. They assume the battle servers are reachable at `192.168.1.2`

#### AoE: DE

```toml
[[Games.age1.BattleServers]]
Region = 'local'
IPv4 = '192.168.1.2'
BsPort = 30001
WebSocketPort = 30002
```

#### AoE II: DE

```toml
[[Games.age2.BattleServers]]
Region = 'local'
Name = 'Local'
IPv4 = '192.168.1.2'
BsPort = 30003
WebSocketPort = 30004
OutOfBandPort = 30005
```

#### AoE III: DE

```toml
[[Games.age3.BattleServers]]
Region = 'local'
IPv4 = '192.168.1.2'
BsPort = 30006
WebSocketPort = 30007
OutOfBandPort = 30008
```

#### AoM: RT

```toml
[[Games.athens.BattleServers]]
Region = 'local'
IPv4 = '192.168.1.2'
BsPort = 30009
WebSocketPort = 30010
OutOfBandPort = 30011
```

## Simplest way to use an online-like Battle Server

### Assumptions

* You will only run a single Battle Server instance per game at most.
* The server is installed in `<server>`. E.g., `C:\AgeLANServer`.
* The game is installed in `<game>`. E.g. `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\AoE2DE`.

Replace the placeholders with the actual paths.

### Steps

1. Make sure the server has the certificate pair generated in `<server>/resources/certificates`, otherwise, generate it
   by running `<server>/bin/genCert`.
2. Execute the `PowerShell` interpreter (can be installed on non-Windows systems too).
3. Change directory to the game directory with `cd "<game>"`.
4. Run `ls` to check if `BattleServer.exe` exists, if it does not, run `cd BattleServer`.
5. Time to run the `BattleServer.exe`, run one or more of the following commands depending on the game you want to;
    * AoE: DE:
   ```
   & ".\BattleServer.exe" -simulationPeriod 25 -relayBroadcastPort 0 -region local -bsPort 30001 webSocketPort 30002 -sslKey "<server>/resources/certificates/key.pem" -sslCert "<server>/resources/certificates/cert.pem" 
   ```
    * AoE II: DE:
    ```
    & ".\BattleServer.exe" -simulationPeriod 125 -relayBroadcastPort 0 -region local -name Local -bsPort 30003 webSocketPort 30004 -outOfBandPort 30005 -sslKey "<server>/resources/certificates/key.pem" -sslCert "<server>/resources/certificates/cert.pem"
    ```
    * AoE III: DE:
    ```
    & ".\BattleServer.exe" -simulationPeriod 50 -relayBroadcastPort 0 -region local -bsPort 30006 webSocketPort 30007 -outOfBandPort 30008 -sslKey "<server>/resources/certificates/key.pem" -sslCert "<server>/resources/certificates/cert.pem"
    ```
    * AoM: RT:
    ```
    & ".\BattleServer.exe" -simulationPeriod 50 -relayBroadcastPort 0 -region local -bsPort 30009 webSocketPort 30010 -outOfBandPort 30011 -sslKey "<server>/resources/certificates/key.pem" -sslCert "<server>/resources/certificates/cert.pem"
    ```
6. Open `<server>/resources/config.toml` and add the corresponding configuration inside `[Games]` for the game you are
   running the
   Battle Server for. Replace `<server-ip>` with the actual server IP address (e.g., `192.168.1.2`):
    * AoE: DE:
   ```toml
    [[Games.age1.BattleServers]]
    Region = 'local'
    IPv4 = '<server-ip>'
    BsPort = 30001
    WebSocketPort = 30002   
   ```
    * AoE II: DE:
    ```toml
    [[Games.age2.BattleServers]]
    Region = 'local'
    Name = 'Local'
    IPv4 = '<server-ip>'
    BsPort = 30003
    WebSocketPort = 30004
    OutOfBandPort = 30005
    ```
    * AoE II: DE:
    ```toml
    [[Games.age3.BattleServers]]
    Region = 'local'
    IPv4 = '<server-ip>'
    BsPort = 30006
    WebSocketPort = 30007
    OutOfBandPort = 30008
    ```
    * AoM: RT:
    ```toml
    [[Games.athens.BattleServers]]
    Region = 'local'
    IPv4 = '<server-ip>'
    BsPort = 30009
    WebSocketPort = 30010
    OutOfBandPort = 30011
    ```
7. Start the game as you normally would and then:
    * AoE DE: Click on "Multiplayer" then on "Create Game", you may select the "Region", "local", or leave as default.
      Players can
      join matches by clicking on "Multiplayer" and then on "Lobby Browser".
    * AoE II: DE: Click on "Multiplayer" then on "Host Game", you may select the "Server", "Local" or leave as default.
      Players can join matches by clicking on "Multiplayer" and then on "Find Custom Game" (Lobby Browser) or by being
      invited.
      Players can observe games by going to "Multiplayer" then "Find Custom Game" and finally "Spectate Games".
    * AoE III: DE: Click on "Multiplayer" (make sure the that "Online" is selected at top right) and then on "Host a
      Casual Game", you may select the "Region", "local", or leave as default. Players can join games by going to "
      Multiplayer" then "Browse Games" and, observe games by enabling here "Spectator Mode".
    * AoM: RT: Click on "Multiplayer" and then on "Host", you may select the "Region", "local", or leave as default.
      Players can join games by going to "Multiplayer" then "Browse Games" (and observe games too).
