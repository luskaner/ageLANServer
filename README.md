# Age LAN Server

Age LAN Server (formerly *AoE 2 DE LAN Server*) is a web server (with its launcher) that allows you to play multiplayer
lobbies without having an
internet
connection **to the game server**  ensuring the game multiplayer functionality is still available even if the official
server
is in maintenance or is eventually shutdown.

*Note: It is not strictly limited to LAN only.*

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You will still need a custom launcher to bypass the online-only restriction that is imposed by the game to being
> connected to the internet and Steam or Xbox Live, depending on the platform and version, to fully play offline. My
> other [project](https://github.com/luskaner/ageLANServerLauncherCompanion) provides the files and information to
> download a Steam Emulator and play 100% offline.

## Unimplemented features

<details>
<summary>List of unimplemented features</summary>

- ❌ **Matchmaking**: does not make sense having a likely ephimeral server with limited users, use the official server
  for
  that.
- ❌ **Achievements**: only the official server should be able to. Meeting the requirements of an achievement during a
  match might cause issues (see [Troubleshooting](https://github.com/luskaner/ageLANServer/wiki/Troubleshooting)
  for more details).
- ❌ **Leaderboards**: will appear empty.
- ❌ **Clans**: all players are outside clans. Browsing clan will appear empty and creating one will always result in
  error.
- ❌ **Lobby ban player**: will appear like it works but doesn't.
- ❌ **Report/Block player**: will appear like it works but doesn't.

*Note: Most of these do not apply to Age of Empires: Definitive Edition.*

</details>

### Verification

The verification process ensures that the files you download are the same as the ones that were uploaded by the
maintainer.

<details>
    <summary>Verification steps</summary>

1. Check the release tag is verified with the committer's signature key (*as all commits must be*).
2. Download the ```..._checksums.txt``` and ```..._checksums.txt.sig``` files.
3. Import the [release public key](release_public.key) and import it to your keyring if you haven't already.
4. Verify the ```..._checksums.txt``` file with the ```..._checksums.txt.sig``` file.
5. Verify the SHA-256 checksum list inside ```..._checksums.txt``` with the downloaded archives.

Exceptions on tag/commit signature:

* Tags:
    * *v1.2.0-rc.5*: mantainer error.
* Commits:
    * *631cfa1* through *9eb66cf* (*both included*): rebase and merge PR issue.
    * *55697d4*: rebase of dependabot.
    * *feb28de*: partially verified due to dependabot.
    * *d2b1749*, *82ca9f1* and *baa75ce*: merge mistake.

</details>

## Installation

Both the launcher and server work out of the box without any installation. Just download the archives,
decompress and run them.

## How it works

### Server

The server is simple web server that listens to the game's API requests. The server reimplements
the minimum required API surface to allow the game to work with lobbies. NO data is stored or sent via the internet.

*Note: See the [server README](server/README.md) for more details.*

### Launcher

The launcher allows to easily play the game in lobbies while still allowing the official launcher to be used for online
play.

<details>
    <summary>Features</summary>

- Automatically start/stop the server or connect to an existing one.
- (Optional) Use an isolated metadata (except AoE I) directory to avoid potential issues with the official
  game.
- (Optional) Modify the hosts file to:
    - Redirect the game's API requests to the LAN server.
    - Proxy certain requests:
        - CDN so it does not detect the official game status.
        - Chat and user names show properly.
- (Optional) Install a self-signed certificate to allow the game to connect to the LAN server.
- (except AoE I) Add a certificate to the game's store to allow the game to connect to the LAN server.
- (Optional) Run custom configuration commands to setup/revert the configuration.
- (Windows Optional) Re-broadcast the battle server through other network interfaces apart from the most priority one.
- Automatically find and start the game.

Afterwards, it reverses any changes to allow the official launcher to connect to the official servers.
</details>

*Note: See the [launcher README](launcher/README.md) for more details.*

## Simplest way to use it

1. **Download** the proper *full* asset from the latest
   stable release from https://github.com/luskaner/ageLANServer/releases.
2. **Uncompress** it somewhere.
3. *Windows Optional*: *You may need to add the launcher/server binaries to the exception list of your Antivirus*.
4. *Windows Optional*: Unblock the `.exe` files as
   explained [here](https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/5357-unblock-file-windows-10-a.html)
5. If not using the Steam or Xbox launcher, **edit the `launcher/resources/config.<game_title>.toml` file** with a text
   editor (like Notepad)
   and modify the `Client.Executable` section to point to the game launcher path. In this case, you also need to modify
   `Client.Path` to point to the game's directory.
   **You will need to use a custom launcher (plus what my
   other [repo](https://github.com/luskaner/ageLANServerLauncherCompanion) provides) for 100% offline play**.
6. If you are using AoM and don't have AoE II: DE installed on Steam edit the
   `battle-server-manager/resources/config.athens.toml` file and point `Executable.Path` to the AoE II: DE
   BattleServer.exe executable (it's portable), for example, 'S:
   \SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\AoE2DE\BattleServer\BattleServer.exe'.
7. **Execute `launcher/start_<game_title>` script**: you will be asked for admin elevation and
   confirmation of other dialogs as needed, you will also need to allow the connections via the Microsoft Defender
   Firewall or any other.
8. **Repeat the above steps for every PC** (except the point 6) you want to play in LAN with by running the *launcher*,
   the first PC to
   launch it will host the "server" and the rest will auto-discover and be prompted to connnect to it.
9. In the game, just host a new lobby via the Multiplayer section. Setting it to public visibility is recommended.
10. If the lobby is Public, they can join directly in the browser or you can **Invite friends** by searching them by
    name
    and sending an invite as needed. If the game allows, you can share the link to join the lobby automatically (only
    works if already
    in-game).

## Standalone execution

<details>
    <summary>Server instructions</summary>

1. **Download** the proper *server* asset from latest
   stable [release](https://github.com/luskaner/ageLANServer/releases).
2. **Generate the certificate** by simply executing `bin/genCert`.
3. If needed **edit the [config](server/resources/config/config.toml) file**.
4. **Run** the `server` binary for all games or the `start_` game title specific script.

</details>

<details>
    <summary>Launcher instructions</summary>

1. **Download** the proper *launcher* asset from latest
   stable [release](https://github.com/luskaner/ageLANServer/releases).
2. If needed **edit the `launcher/resources/config.<game_title>.toml` and/or `launcher/resources/config.toml` files**.
   You will need to edit the `Client.Executable` section to point to the game launcher path if using a custom launcher
   which you will need to use
   a custom launcher for 100% offline play.
3. **Run** the `start_...` script.

*Note: If you have any issues run the `bin/config revert -a`.*
</details>

<details>
    <summary>Battle Server Manager instructions</summary>

1. **Download** the proper *battle-server-manager* asset from latest
   stable [release](https://github.com/luskaner/ageLANServer/releases).
2. If needed **edit the `battle-server-manager/resources/config.<game_title>.toml`**.
3. **Run** the `start_...` script.
