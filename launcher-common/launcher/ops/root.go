// Package ops is what a session does to the machine, and how it remembers so it
// can undo it.
//
// It is not a grab bag of command line helpers, which is what the name it used
// to carry suggested. Everything here touches something outside the process:
// the hosts file, the certificate stores, the game's user data, the game itself,
// the servers it discovers and the battle server it starts. That is also why so
// much of it needs elevation, and why Revert exists at all.
//
// Config is the state those operations share. One is built per run and carries
// what has been changed so far, which is what makes a failed run reversible
// rather than merely reported.
