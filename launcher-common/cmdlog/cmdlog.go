// Package cmdlog is the console renderer every program in this workspace prints
// through.
//
// It exists so that the rule is the same in all of them: a message goes to the
// file log as plain text and to the console as a styled line, and the two are the
// same words. The file log is read with grep and with editors that do not
// understand a terminal, so a marker, a colour or an emoji in there is corruption;
// the console is the only place where any of it means something.
//
// The levels are the ones in launcher-common/ui. Which one a message gets is the
// only judgement call: a failure stops the run, a warning does not, a step is
// happening, info is a note, and Detail and Fault are the lines under the message
// above them, the latter in red because it is the part of a failure the reader acts
// on.
